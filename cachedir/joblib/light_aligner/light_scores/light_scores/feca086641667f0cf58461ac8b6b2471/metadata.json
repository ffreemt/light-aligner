According to two sets of data from He Zhaoxiong (1980-1990), suicides occur primarily in the daytime (0600 hrs to 1900 hrs). The first set of data shows that daytime suicides make up 72% of the total, while the second set of data reveals a proportion of 62%. This makes for a marked difference from overseas data, which show suicides to occur mostly after nightfall. Li Wenshi,  et al ., report that the number of suicides was the highest between 0600 hrs and 2100 hrs, which add up to 86.6% of the total. [130] Gao Wei,  et al ., found in their examination of 878 cases of suicide among youths aged between 13 and 19 that 21.18% or 186 of these suicides occurred in the early morning or morning, with the peak time at 1015 hrs; 692 or 78.82% of the suicides occurred in the afternoons or the evening with the peak time at 1930 hrs. Hu Yan,  et al ., found after an examination of 1,756 cases of suicide that 80% of suicides by poisoning occurred in the afternoon with the peak period between 1730 hrs and 2130 hrs.[132] This time of day is when people come home to spend time with family or to be alone after a long day of work or school. Interaction with family members increases the likelihood of conflicts, a leading cause of suicide. When individuals are alone, they are prone to anxiety and fear, and can easily feel helpless and even world-weary. There is no one around to help allay their low spirits and distress, thus the possibility of suicide increases. Furthermore, the pesticides used for suicide in rural areas and the medications used for suicide in urban areas in China are generally stored at home and are thus easily accessible.', 'The Spring Festival travel crush is a phenomenon unique to China. In addition to the 150 million rural migrant workers in cities, there are also hundreds of millions of Chinese who work and live away from their hometowns. This creates a massive flow of people heading home for the Spring Festival each year. People are willing to traverse hundreds of miles to be with their families. The tradition of going home for the Spring Festival goes back to ancient times. In 2004, a total of 1.9 billion trips were made during the Spring Festival travel crush, and in 2005, the number rose to almost 1.95 billion. In 2006, the figure passed the two billion mark. In particular, in 2003, 134.7 million passenger trips were made by train during the crush (with an addition of 1.667 billion by road and 9 million by air). In 2003, the figure was 137 million, 140 million in 2004, 149 million in 2006, 159 million in 2007, 210 million in 2010, peaked at 230 million in 2011, and dropped slightly to 220 million in 2012. Such figures far exceed the carrying capacity of China\u2019s railway system. As such, trains are severely overcrowded and signs of mental illness are frequently seen among passengers. Acts of violence and suicide attempts have occurred on numerous occasions. Each year, during the Spring Festival travel crush, there have been reports of passengers killing themselves by jumping off moving trains. For many, especially those with a history of mental illness, are under stress, or already nervous because they are carrying large amounts of cash, travelling long-distances in crowded and poorly-ventilated spaces while sleep-deprived can trigger panic or other negative psychological responses. A number of passengers have jumped from heights at Beijing West Station after long-distance travel in a less-than-clear state of mind. The incidence of mental illness spikes each year during the Spring Festival travel crush. In fact, there have been trains serving migrant workers on which multiple cases of suicide and harm to others have been reported. According to statistics from the Guangzhou Railway Police, the number of suicides by passengers while traveling in trains has increased in recent years. Ten acts of suicide were committed on-board trains departing from Guangzhou Station during the Spring Festival travel crush in 2001. Another 12 occurred during the same period in 2002. Data show that sudden onset of mental illness on trains most frequently occur on those heading west from coastal areas, with more than 95% of those afflicted being migrant workers. These overcrowded \u201cspecial\u201d trains travel for many hours with poor ventilation. Thus, passengers are prone to developing anxiety and hallucinations as well as exhibit symptoms of mental illness suddenly.']", "pairs": "None", "scale": "'max'", "showplot": "True", "saveplot": "True", "extra_dict": "None"}}
