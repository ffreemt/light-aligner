1.6798	I keep hearing these recordings online of a child somewhere crying and screaming: “Mommy, don’t leave me! I love you so much, Mommy. . . .” As a mother, anytime I hear such a voice, I can’t help but feel a cold shiver run through my entire body.	偶尔听到一个音频，不知道是哪里的孩子在声嘶厉竭的哭喊：妈妈，你不要抛下我，我很喜欢你……听到这样的声音，我们这些做母亲的人总会浑身发冷。
1.6670	All those questions, they remain unanswered.	所有的疑问，都无人回应

1.5448	Today is March 8, Women’s Day in China. Everyone is sending flowers to women online today. Every March 8 when I was a kid, my girlfriends and I would always sing: “March 8 Women’s Day, the boys will work, the girls will play, the boys will stay inside, doing their homework all day.” We would sing it in the Wuhan dialect, which created a certain melody and rhyme scheme that you could never get tired of. Thinking about it now, if feels like such a distant memory.	今天是三八妇女节。大家都在网上向女人献花。小时候，每逢这天我们一群女孩肯定会高唱：“三八妇女节，男伢好造业，女伢玩游戏，男伢在屋里做作业。”这段歌谣，得用武汉话唱，那种腔调和韵律，才会有千回百转的味道。想起来，是多么遥远的事。
1.5347	How do you view the relationship between a writer and their city?	14、您如何看待作家和城市的关系？
1.5263	Actually, I suspect that Professor Du had even more questions, because after his seventh question, he left a line of ellipses, which seems to indicate that he wasn’t finished with his line of questioning. Actually, for those of us here in Wuhan, we have even more questions we could raise. A shame, then, that all those questions, they remain unanswered.	其实杜教授应有更多疑问，第七问之后，他留下一排省略号。也就是说，他并没有问完。实际上，我们在武汉的人，还可以提出更多疑问。可惜，几乎所有的疑问，都无人回应。
1.5240	Does the fact that you are the former chair of the Hubei Writers Association serve as a kind of protection? Or does it come with a negative impact?	12、前作协主席这个身份，对你有保护作用还是有负面影响？
1.5203	Because our community is mostly made up of people formerly affiliated with the old Design School, everyone knows each other here; we are all former coworkers and longtime neighbors, so seeing so many of our friends suddenly taken away is just too difficult to face and has left us in a state of fear. As this dark cloud descends on our city, elderly residents living by themselves like my wife and me are left completely helpless!!	由于我们的社区基本上就是原来设计院的职工生活区，所以大家都很熟悉，都是老同事，老邻居，所以他们的突然离去，我们感到惊恐，感到难以接受。在那个黑云压城的日子，我们两个空巢老人是多么无助！！

1.4843	You people in charge need to hear what the people are saying; you need to pay attention to what we are requesting. I’m not speaking just for myself; most members of the public all feel the same way, and I am speaking for all of us. We are not trying to cause trouble; we are just trying to make a living. We need to put food on the table. You need to try to think about the situation from our perspective, the perspective of ordinary citizens.	你们上级部门，应该体恤民情，应该多多关注我们的诉求，这不是我一个人的呼声，这是广大人民群众的呼声。我们不是闹事，我们要生存，要吃饭，要喝水。你们也要想一下，站在我们这些普通人的角度来想一下问题。
1.4825	Once this outbreak has passed, what are you most looking forward to doing?	15、如果疫情过去，您最想做的事是什么？
1.4783	The reason I still have faith in this world is owing to those kindhearted and rational people who are still busy working hard for something good.	这世道，之所以还让我抱有期待，是看到仍然有这些善良而理性的人在为之努力和忙碌。
1.4781	Fang Fang: I really don’t care. I really have no interest in how other people perceive me. As long as I can face myself, I am happy. How critics view me is their business, not mine.	方方：无所谓，我根本不在乎别人怎么评价我。我自己活得自在就可以了。他们想怎么评就怎么评，也不关我的事。
1.4775	Finally, there are a few bits of news I want to record here:	另有几个小消息，记录在此。
1.4732	You can see that those community workers are really thoughtful; you can also see how hard that supermarket boss works overseeing all those grocery pickups. Online shopping, binge-watching, sleeping: This is our life now.	可见，社区服务还很细心，超市老板相当辛苦。只是更多的武汉人，眼下只能这样活着：团购，追剧，睡觉。
1.4689	That is the best news I heard today. That’s right; the arrival of a new life is the best hope that heaven can give us for the future.	这是今天最好的消息。是的，新生命的降临，就是上天赐予的最好希望。
1.4664	Forget it. Going mad won’t solve our problems. If we drop dead, they won’t care anyway. Better to simply not talk about these things.	算了。疯掉也解决不了问题，死了他们也不会在乎。不说这些。
1.4634	Another important benefit of using WeChat Pay and Alipay is that we can not only pinpoint the whereabouts of carriers, but we can also track down everyone they had close contact with during a given time frame (from November 1, 2019, until now). We will be able to track everyone using this system!	通过电话微信支付宝找人，还有一个重要意义，同时精准锁定所有人相当一段时间内的行动轨迹（11月1日至今），谁也跑不了！
1.4587	I may be retired, but I still have enough energy to take you to court.	我虽退休，但打场官司的精力还是有的
1.4517	My child, do you understand what I have been trying to say? Now I’d like to leave you with a line of poetry: “I too was once young like you, and back then we were as you are today.”	孩子，你听得懂吗？现在，我要把这一句诗送给你：“我也有过你们这样的青春，那时的我们就像今天的你们。”
1.4513	All this suddenly makes me think of a line from Haizi’s poetry, which I have slightly revised and posted here: “Wuhan, tonight I care not about the boneheads, I care only about you.”23	突然想起海子的一首诗句，稍加改动，留在这里：武汉，今夜我不关心脑残，我只关心你。
1.4475	And I don’t always maintain a normal healthy outlook; sometimes I get anxious. And then there are times when I am really at a loss as to what to do. When there are so many unknown factors that you face, you can sometimes be left very confused inside.	我不存在一直保持平常心的，我也有紧张的时候。也有不知道如何是好的时候。在很多事情处于不确定时，心也是乱的。
1.4461	Can’t you see? Wuhan is on the verge of reopening. I may be retired, but I still have enough energy to take you to court.	君不见，武汉马上开城。我虽已退休，但是打场官司的精力还是有的。
1.4433	Open up a space so we can all have a good cry.	开辟一个空间，让我们同哭吧
1.4433	One more week before we see a turning point? I certainly hope so, but I’m also hoping that we don’t end up disappointed again.	一周内会出现拐点吗？我希望如此，但又担心希望落空。
1.4417	Does the fact that no one is willing to accept responsibility have something to do with the fact that Zhong Nanshan seems to be the only one with the authority to reveal the truth to the public?	4、人人都不肯承担责任，真的只有钟南山才有资格向公众报告实情吗？
1.4408	I’m actually not at all afraid of death. I have, after all, already made it past the average life span in China; it is only a matter of time before death comes, which is natural. However, if I die from this virus, that would, without question, be considered a form of “murder.” I’m not going to stand for that!	其实，我对死亡并无太多恐惧，我已经活过了中国人的平均年龄，正常死亡是迟早的事。但是如果因染疫而死，那无异于“他杀“，我是于心不甘的！
1.4392	Today I would like to reach out to my childhood friend who was with me from elementary school all the way up through high school and wish her a speedy recovery. I would also like to extend my thoughts to one of my middle school classmates, whose husband is trying to find a place for his kidney dialysis treatment; I hope she takes care of herself during these exhausting days spent running around trying to get treatment for her husband.	今天特别想祝愿我的儿时伙伴、从小学到高中的同学尽快康复；也祝愿另一位中学同学，愿她的先生可以顺利透析，愿在这些日子奔波操劳的她多多保重。
1.4391	Where we were back then is where you are now.	那时的我们，就像今天的你们
1.4390	The toxicity level of the virus seems to be diminishing;	1、目前病毒的毒性已明显减弱；
1.4346	Outside in the streets they are testing the buses before they start running again, and down by the subway station they are cleaning things up and disinfecting everything; everything is getting ready to start operating again. Everyone is passing this information around to each other and we are all excited to see the city coming back to life. And as for the numbers that used to terrify us each day, they are now at zero, as they have been for the past five days in a row.	街上，好几路公交车开始试运行，地铁站也在清理和消毒，为即将开始的通行做准备。这些消息，人们纷纷相互传达，均有惊喜之感。而之前每天公布的惊悚数字，现在一律是0。持续为0，已有五天。
1.4315	After many days of clinical treatment, doctors now have more experience with what treatments and medications are most effective.	四是医生们通过这么多天的临床治疗，用药也有了经验。
1.4304	Do you agree with the idea that writers should shoulder more social responsibility besides just writing?	7、您认可作家除了写作，还应该承担起更多社会责任吗？
1.4285	I opened the window in the afternoon and noticed that the sun had come out again. I believe that today marks the Seventh Day18 since the passing of Li Wenliang? The Seventh Day is when those who have embarked on their distant journey return one last time. When Li Wenliang’s soul in heaven comes back to this place of old one final time, I wonder what he will see.	中午开窗，看到太阳又出来了。今天是李文亮的头七吧？头七是远行者回望的日子。李文亮在天有灵，重返故地，他会看到什么呢？
1.4243	Once the music has ended, we will seek out a cure.	此曲终了，我们再寻解药
1.4205	The people of Wuhan have a popular saying: “When you’re busy, you work yourself to death; when you’re idle, you bore yourself to death!” But now it seems clear: When you are idle it is the psychological stress that gets you; when you are busy it is the physical stress that gets you. We all need to grit our teeth and get through this together.	武汉人喜欢说一句话：忙的忙死，闲的闲死。现在对比，似乎更加鲜明。闲人心理压力大，忙人身体压力大。大家都在咬紧牙关，共同扛着武汉。
1.4193	March 19: Today is our 59th day at home. Z’s mouth ulcer is much better. I guess we bought the right medicine. This afternoon for lunch I reheated the waxed-duck and Chinese radish soup from yesterday, but threw in a bunch of other ingredients like cabbage; that way, with a bowl of rice, it will be a full nutritious meal: another delicious soup dish. Hopefully, tomorrow his mouth will be good enough for us to start eating normal solid foods again.	二、3月19日：自闭第五十九天。Z的口腔溃疡好了很多，看来买的药很对症。今天中午在腊鸭炖萝卜的基础上，加很多剁碎的大白菜，这样泡米饭吃就是一顿营养足，又美味的流食。明天应该能恢复正常饮食了。
1.4154	I am recording all the fragmented stories so that those criminals know: Besides the infected patients and the dead, there are a lot of other victims of this calamity. All us ordinary people have paid a price for this human catastrophe.	我记录下这些细碎，是要告诉那些有罪的人们：不是只有死者和病人承受了灾难，我们所有的普通人，都在为这场人祸付出代价。
1.4138	I heard from a professor friend that representatives from the World Health Organization in Beijing said that, to date, the only medicine proven to be effective in fighting the novel coronavirus seems to be remdesivir.	二、一位教授告诉我，世界卫生组织在北京说，治疗新冠肺炎，目前可能唯一真实有效的药物就是瑞德西韦。
1.4074	These past few days I have been utterly exhausted and have a bad headache. A reader named TA left a message on one of my WeChat posts yesterday, saying that she could sense my exhaustion from my writing. TA’s intuition is really spot-on. I need to start reducing the amount of time I spend writing and take more time to get adequate rest. I’ll stop here for today.	这几天，好累，头痛。有个网友在我昨天的微信下留言，说能从文中看到我的疲惫。TA的直觉真的很厉害。我现在必须尽量压缩写作时间，让自己休息。今天不想多写了。
1.4066	During these days as the disease runs rampant through our society and we remain cloistered inside our homes, I keep wondering why the Chinese people have been destined to face such a cruel fate! Why have our people continued to face calamity after calamity? When I think of all this, I feel like the only thing left to do is pray. And so I pray that after this calamity has passed, China will face a world of peace and prosperity . . . at least, that is my hope.	在这瘟疫猖獗的日子里，在这漫长的封城的日子里，我一直在想，我们中国人为什么命这么苦啊！我们这个民族为什么总是灾难深重？想到这一切，我只有祈祷，祈求在大灾大难之后，中国会有一个清平的世界……但愿。
1.4036	There are actually a lot of voices out there online that have been criticizing you or raising suspicions about you. Do those voices ever make you uncomfortable or depressed? Amid all this fear and chaos, how do you manage to maintain a normal healthy outlook?	11、其实网上也有很多质疑或者反对您的声音，面对这样的声音，您会不会觉得委屈或者伤心？您在这样的情况下，在周围人的恐惧和慌乱中，是怎么保持平常心的？
1.3942	Back when you wrote the novel The City of Wuchang how did you balance the actual history with your fictional imagination? What is the meaning of recording history for contemporary people’s lives?	10、当初在创作《武昌城》时，您是如何平衡真实的历史和虚构的想象？您觉得铭记历史对于当下生活的人们有何意义。
1.3926	For the time being, most people are not too concerned with the big issues. What’s the use of worrying about those problems, anyway? Most people who are not infected are trying to remain optimistic.	现在，大的问题，大家都基本不太担心了。担心也没有什么用。没被感染，就会乐观。
1.3899	Just before this, the National Health Commission had already sent a team of specialists to Jinyintan Hospital to investigate. They came up with a set of standards for diagnosis, such as having visited the Huanan Seafood Market, fever, and a positive test result for the presence of the virus; only when all three of these criteria were met could a patient be confirmed as positive. They were especially strict about that third criteria, even when in reality very few people were actually tested.	“此前，国家卫健委派的专家组已经到金银潭医院做了调查，做了一套诊断标准，要有华南海鲜市场的接触史，要有发烧症状，病毒检测呈阳性，这三条标准都达到才能确诊。尤其是第三点，非常苛刻，实际上极少有人能去做病毒检测。”
1.3896	I really feel sorry for all those young people who are part of this. Once they start to take those ultra-leftists as their teachers and mentors, I’m afraid that many of them will be spending the rest of their lives in a dark abyss.	8、可惜了那么多年轻人。当他们把极左人士当作自己的人生导师时，他们这辈子恐怕都会在黑暗的深渊中挣扎。
1.3867	For dinner I had a small bowl of rice porridge. In a little bit I’ll go on the treadmill to get some exercise. Little by little, bit by bit, I’m recording everything here in my little file.	晚上喝小米粥。一会儿去跑步机上活动一下。点点滴滴，记录在案。
1.3850	The coronavirus outbreak seems to have stabilized, but people’s hearts have not.	疫情看上去稳定，但人心似不太稳
1.3838	The weather remains clear and warm, yet here I am, lying in bed looking at my phone.	天气依然晴好。也很暖和。躺在床上看手机。
1.3833	Forget it, I don’t want to go on anymore about this right now. I’ll just pray that from today onward Mr. Wang does a better job of curing the sick and helping the injured. And as he is saving them, I hope he saves himself, too.	算了，这个时候，实在不想多说。还是祈愿王先生今后更加努力地救死扶伤吧。拯救他人的同时，也拯救自己。
1.3801	I was especially moved by one classmate who passed on a message from one of our teachers; he told me to: “take care of yourself, drink plenty of water, and be sure to have some smoked Asian wormwood. . . .”	特別令我感动的是，有同学转达了一位老师对我的关心，他要我“多保重，多喝水，多熏艾草…”
1.3773	I have already fought that beautiful battle.	那美好的仗我已经打过了；
1.3719	There is a line from your diary that reads: “One speck of dust from an era may not seem like much, but when it falls on your head it is like a mountain crashing down on you.” Those words have become the single most widely circulated sentence of this entire coronavirus outbreak; somehow that sentence has been seen as emblematic of everything we have experienced. Looking back, do you feel that those words have transformed into a kind of prophecy?	3、“时代的一粒灰，落在个人头上，就是一座山。”这句话成了此次疫情中最广为流传的一句话，回过头来看这句话，有没有觉得它变成了一个预言？
1.3686	I find Mr. Liu’s suggestion to be quite bold and interesting. However, there would still be a lot of issues that would need to be resolved, such as how to deal with all the sewage waste produced there, and I’m afraid that it would be too cold for patients to live in medical tents during this time of year. I’m not an expert in these matters, but perhaps various specialists will have ways of getting around these problems?	这是一个很大胆也很有意思的想法。但不知道在江心这样的地方，污水排放问题该怎么解决，而帐篷在寒冷的早春，是否能住得了人？这些我不懂，或许专家有办法？
1.3686	But I’m not sure if this will even be able to be posted. If any of my friends are able to view it online, please leave a comment so I know it went through. Weibo has a special feature that makes the user believe their post was successfully uploaded when it actually remains invisible to other users. Once I learned about this programming trick, I realized that technology can sometimes be every bit as evil as a contagious virus.	只是，我并不知道这一条能不能发出来。如有朋友能看到，就请留个言，让我知道可以发了。微博有一种技术：就是你以为你发出去了，但其实没有人能看得到。自从知道有此一技术后，方明白：高科技作起恶来，一点不比瘟疫弱。
1.3641	Unless you have lived your entire life in Wuhan, I’m afraid it might be difficult for you to understand this or the feeling of pain that we are going through right now. For more than 20 days now, I have been relying on sleeping pills to fall asleep each night. I blame myself for not having enough courage to face everything.	没有从小到老都生活在武汉的人，恐怕很难有这样的心情，也很难理解这份伤痛。二十天来，我每天都要靠服安眠药才能入睡。我自责自己，终究没有足够的勇气。
1.3634	According to my doctor friend, the spread is extremely difficult to contain, which is indeed our greatest challenge.	医生朋友说，蔓延难以控制。看来这真的是个难题。
1.3623	As a victim quarantined here in this virus zone, I record snapshots of my life and reflections. Most diaries are never preserved, but these thousands of collective curses and attacks will ensure that my diary will last forever.	我，被封在疫区，作为受难者，记录下一些生活琐碎和感想，这日记多半留不下来。但是这成百上千人的集结叫骂，却会让我的日记永存。
1.3577	Let me say a little bit about some of the things I have been facing these past two days.	说说我自己这两天面对的事吧。
1.3535	There is no longer a shortage of medical supplies, and people are better educated on how to protect themselves;	三是医用物资不再窘迫，有了自我保护的条件；
1.3527	Right now the god of the underworld is still playing his death fugue. Once the music has ended, we will seek out a cure.	死亡还在这里演奏它的进行曲。此曲终了，我们再寻解药。
1.3523	Forget it, let’s not talk about this stuff.	算了，不扯这些。
1.3520	Today I am actually feeling quite bad, and I think I really need to get some things off my chest.	今天的心情，其实有很多难堪。我已有不吐不快之感。
1.3494	Today I saw an interview in Caijing with the Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-Yung.11 Dr. Yuen was a member of the third team of specialists that came to Wuhan. During this outbreak he was appointed as a specialist to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 task force, and he is also a member of the Advisory Council for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Some of the information he revealed to the reporter in this interview was quite shocking.	今天还看到财新记者对香港袁国勇院士的一篇采访文章。袁院士是第三批来武汉的专家。在此次疫情中，他也是世卫组织新冠肺炎联合考察组的专家，以及香港特区政府专家顾问团成员。他对记者透露出的信息，真是让人有震惊感。
1.3485	I also want to ask: When will those public officials go do their work without taking any more commemorative photos? When will our political leaders go on a survey trip to a hospital without expecting people to sing songs of gratitude or put on big performances for them? My people, only when you understand common sense will you be able to truly understand how to take care of practical matters. Otherwise, how can we expect the people’s suffering to ever end?	我还想说：什么时候公务员们前去工作不举旗帜不再合影留念，什么时候领导视察没人唱歌感恩，也没人做戏表演，人们，你们才算懂得了基本常识，才算知道了什么叫作务实。不然，百姓的苦难还有个完吗？
1.3406	Now that we have some leads, we need to keep investigating! If we keep asking the right questions, we will eventually get to the cause. All of us want to know why there was a need to conceal such an important thing from the public.	好了，线索来了。该查的，就顺着查吧！一个一个地询问，总能问出一个所以然。我和我们，都想知道，这么大的事，为什么要隐瞒。
1.3400	I take legal responsibility for everything I am saying here. As you fought the coronavirus, average people like us were extremely supportive and gave you our full cooperation. But after having been locked down for so many days, more than 50 days, even those who may have been sick to begin with should have recovered by now. You should arrange some chartered buses for us, but how come you government people haven’t taken any action?	我对我说的话负法律责任。你们防控病毒，我们普通平民百姓是非常支持非常配合的。但是关了这么多天，50多天，就算不健康也健康了。你们应该搞点对点的包车，你们政府咋完全不行动起来哩？
1.3391	I’ll stop here for today, but I want to emphasize one thing: The presence of those ultra-leftists represents an existential threat to China and her people. If the entire Reform Era is destroyed at their hands, it would be the ultimate slap in the face to my entire generation. So come at me with all you’ve got, bring out all your dirty tricks, and tell all your big-name supporters to show their faces too! Let’s see if I’m scared of you!	今天就到这里。我还要重复一句：极左就是中国祸国殃民式的存在。改革开放如果毁在了这些人手里，是我们这代人的耻辱。来吧，把你们所有的招数都拿出来，把你们背后的大牌都喊出来。你看我怕不怕你们！
1.3375	While I’m at it, why don’t I share a few things about myself for those people lacking common sense (including those who have been reporting on me) in order to prevent mistakes with their future posts:	顺便告诉一下那些缺乏常识的人（包括举报者）一点点我的个人情况，以免每次留言都犯错误：
1.3365	Today is day 42 of the lockdown.	今天是封城的第42天。
1.3325	I’m sure that it is not just my brother, my colleague, and me who are short of face masks. There must be many people here in Wuhan without any face masks. But I am confident there isn’t a real shortage of supplies; it’s more a problem of the logistics of how to get them into people’s hands. Right now I just hope those express delivery companies can resume work soon and speed up the delivery of supplies into Wuhan; we need some help to get through these tough times.	我相信，缺乏口罩的，不止我大哥以及我和我的同事。武汉的普通市民缺乏口罩的人一定很多。而且我也相信，口罩并不缺货，缺的只是怎么才能到市民手上。在这里，也只希望快递公司能够早点上班，并且给武汉的货物加一点速度，帮助我们度过难关。
1.3296	Let me wrap up today’s entry with a quote from one of those online memes: “I long not for my trip down to Yangzhou to enjoy the spring scenery in March, I crave only to be able to finally go downstairs by March.”	今天打住，引用段子手的话作为结束语吧：不指望烟花三月下扬州，只但愿烟花三月能下楼。
1.3290	Let me share a few quotes from an interview with Dr. Peng Zhiyong, director of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University:	摘录几段中南医院彭志勇医生对记者访谈时说的话：
1.3269	I would like to again express my thanks to everyone out there who has been lending their attention and support to what is happening in Wuhan, and also to the residents of Wuhan.	继续谢谢大家对武汉和武汉人民的关心关注。我很乐意继续实事报导。
1.3238	But now that we are seeing a change for the better on all these fronts, we can expect the overall situation to start improving at any moment.	而这一切，现在都在改变，转机随时可能出现。
1.3192	So what are ordinary people’s lives like these days? Yesterday I was chatting with my second brother and he sent me another one of my sister-in-law’s sketches of daily life under the quarantine. Her previous preoccupation with online shopping has now been displaced by other things; one of these posts is about what happens when you need medical help; there are two entries that I will share with you:	到了现在，普通百姓的生活又怎样了呢？昨天跟小哥聊天，他又传了小嫂每天记录的一些日常生活。先前的购物已经改成了其他，这里记录的是关于看病的事，共两条。
1.3160	It is only when you are living amid a time of emergency that all the good and evil of human nature comes to the surface. It is only from that experience that you begin to notice things that you never imagined you would ever see. You are left shocked, saddened, and angry, and eventually you get used to it.	一旦到非常时期，人性中的大善和大恶便全都张扬出来。你会从中看到你完全意想不到的东西。你惊愕你悲叹你愤怒，然后你习惯。
1.3109	I returned home on January 21; you can calculate just how many days that it has been now. Every day since then I have been sitting at home eating and sleeping, eating and sleeping. The main thing is that I just don’t know when this will all end. At first they said the quarantine might be lifted on March 1, then they pushed it back to March 10, then March 11; later they said March 15; now Zhong Nanshan is saying it might last until late June.	我1月21号回来的，你自己算我回来多少天了。天天在屋里待着，吃了睡，睡了吃。关键还不晓得这个日子哪一天才能够结束才能够终止。开始说3月1号，然后说3月10号，现在3月11号了，又说3月15号，钟南山又说延期到6月底。
1.3080	Look at me—a novelist documenting all these trivial daily occurrences here in this diary, and yet I somehow follow the direction of my literature to observe, to reflect, to experience, and, ultimately, to set my pen down to paper and write. Don’t tell me this is a mistake?	看看，我这个写小说的人，在我自己每日记录琐碎时，仍然会沿着自己的写作走向，去观察去思考去体会去落笔，这难道还是个错误？
1.3074	I saw a “selfie” video today that was shot by one of the patients at Huoshenshan Hospital. From the video I could tell that the treatment facilities there are quite good and the patients there seem to have a positive outlook. That is exactly the kind of video I was hoping I might be able to see. I hope they all recover soon, and I hope that everything will move forward from here in a more rational and organized manner.	今天还看到一个视频，来自火神山医院。病人自拍。视频中所见，那边医疗环境相当不错，病人也很乐观。这正是我们想看到的。愿他们早点好起来吧，也但愿所有的事情，更加合理，更加有序。
1.3032	The snow is falling. Last night the wind was howling and there was a thunderstorm and today it began to snow. It is quite rare to see such a heavy snow in Wuhan. I heard that the wind ripped open a part of the roof at Leishenshan Hospital last night, which shows just how fierce the storm was. I hope the patients there who were affected are able to be safely transferred to different rooms; it is yet another small crisis for them amid a much larger calamity.	下雪了。昨晚风大雷响，今天便下起了雪。在武汉，下这样大雪的冬天也是不多。听说火神山有几间病房的屋顶被掀开，可见昨夜的风有多大。希望病人能安稳转移，在大劫难中度过这个小的劫难。
1.2992	I have already completed my course;	当跑的路我已经跑尽了；
1.2986	Once news of the outbreak leaked, were those government offices really placing a higher priority on dealing with the leaker than on the actual outbreak?	3、疫情信息泄露后，有关部门真的要优先解决泄露信息的人吗？
1.2981	According to Chinese custom, today marks the true end of the Lunar New Year. I got out of bed, opened the curtain, and the sunlight was so bright and strong that it felt like it was early summer. It really felt refreshing to just let it shine down on me for a moment, and we really need the sunlight to drive away that dark cloud that has enveloped the entire city and to release the pain that has built up inside our hearts.	按中国人的习惯，到今天才算是真正过完年了。起床拉开窗帘，阳光明亮得像是初夏时分，心情顿时一爽。我们多么需要这样的阳光。需要它来驱散笼罩满城的阴霾，来化解郁结人心的痛楚。
1.2972	This afternoon my old classmate who goes by the nickname “Old Fox” sent me a message. Old Fox’s father, Mr. Hu Guorui, was once my poetry teacher. Mr. Hu was an excellent lecturer; a lot of students from other departments also enrolled in his classes, which were always packed. Eventually they had to move his class to a larger classroom in the Laozhaishe building. Back when I was in his class, there was a poem he taught us that wasn’t in our textbook. He recited it to us:	下午，我的同学老狐给我发来消息。老狐的父亲胡国瑞先生是我的老师，给我们开宋词课。胡先生的课讲得好，外系也有不少人来听，教室总是坐满了人，后来还换到老斋舍那边一间大教室去。有一首词，当时书上没有，胡先生便念给我们听：“来往烟波，十年自号西湖长。轻舟小桨，荡出芦花港。得意高歌，夜静声偏朗。无人赏，自家拍掌，唱彻千山响。”胡先生一边念一边击节叫好的样子，至今仍历历在目。老狐是七七级的，喜好徒步旅行，曾全程走完美国最著名的AT路线，一走好几个月。边走边记录，看得人惊心动魄。他是第一个全程走完AT的华人。
1.2962	To my dear internet censors: You had better let the people of Wuhan speak out and express what they want to say! Once they get these things off their chests, they will feel a bit better. We’ve already been locked down in quarantine for more than 10 days and have seen a lot of terrible things. If you won’t even allow us to release some of our pain, if you can’t even permit us to complain a little bit or reflect on what is happening, then you must be intent on driving us all mad!	亲爱的网管们：有些话，你们还是得让武汉人说出来。说出来，心里会好受一点。我们都已经被封在这里十多天了，见到那么多的惨绝人事。如果连发泄一下痛苦都不准，连几句牢骚或一点反思都不准，难道真想让大家疯掉？
1.2950	Among the essays that friends keep sending me on WeChat, there was one by Professor Du Junfei from Nanjing University. Professor Du holds a PhD in sociology and his essays often hit on some very important issues. In this essay of his I just read, he points out seven items:	在朋友转给我的一些微信文章中，我看到南京大学杜骏飞教授的一篇。杜教授是社会学博士，他的文章经常会拎出一些紧要问题。在他的这篇文章中，曾提出七个问题：
1.2932	Director Wang from Leishenshan Hospital even told the media: “We have reached a true turning point in the evolution of this outbreak.” From the new cases coming in, they have noticed that the number of patients with high fevers has decreased and continues to steadily decrease; moreover, there are not a lot of cases of the fever recurring. Director Wang emphasized that he had great confidence that things were improving.	雷神医院的王院长甚至公开对媒体说：真正的疫情拐点已经到来。他们从新发病的情况观察到，发热的数量在下降，是逐渐在降，稳稳地在降，而且没有反弹过。王院长说：“我是很有信心的。”
1.2930	It is a good thing, then, that a few days ago a magazine called The Poet Art & Literature Review (apologies for my ignorance, but I never read this magazine before) emailed me with a few questions. Since they are an arts magazine and not a news organization, the questions they sent over were pretty open-ended. Since we are all in the same field, I decided to answer their questions somewhat freely. Today I’ll share the interview with you below:	好在多日前，一家名为《骚客文艺》的杂志（原谅我孤陋寡闻，没有看过这本杂志）给我传了一份邮件，对我提出几个问题。因为不是新闻媒体，而是一本文艺杂志，他们的问题就会比较松弛一点。想到是同行，所以我的回答也很随意。今天就把这份答问在此录下。
1.2909	I wanted to report some good news; Yi Fan has been taken off the ventilator machine and is awake. He even recorded a short video to say hello to some of his old classmates. Yi Fan’s nine-year-old daughter also made her dad a whole bunch of get-well cards. Hu Zha also came out of his coma; this is really a miracle for the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital in Beijing.	1、报告好消息，易凡已脱机清醒，今天还录了视频和老同学打招呼，易凡9岁的女儿为爸爸手绘了很多贺卡。胡渣也醒过来了，北京中日友好医院创造了奇迹。
1.2902	I saw an interesting post online that summed up where things stand: The first group of people with the coronavirus were infected before the Lunar New Year; the second group of people infected all flooded the hospitals; the third group of people infected flooded the supermarkets; the fourth group of people infected started to blindly sign up for online shopping groups.	今天网上有个总结：第一批感染者是年前的；第二批感染者是挤医院的；第三批感染者是挤超市的；第四批感染者就是瞎团购的。
1.2879	I, on the other hand, as an independent writer, only have my own tiny perspective on things. The only things I can pay attention to and experience are those little details that are happening around me and those real people I encounter in my life. And so that’s all I can write—I provide a record of those trivial things happening around me; I write about my feelings and reflections in real time as things happen in order to leave a record for myself of this life experience.	而我是一个个体写作者，我只有小的视角。我能关注到能体会到的，只有身边一些碎事，以及一个个具体的人。所以，我只能作一点琐事记录，写一点即时感想，为自己留下一份存活过程的纪念。
1.2863	Because there has been an influx of medical workers coming to Wuhan to provide support, the medical professionals can work more effectively;	二则因为增援人手的到来，医护人员可以从容工作；
1.2851	Later in the afternoon my doctor friend sent me a video. The video was of a young man delivering a popular science-style lecture about the coronavirus. In the video he kept repeating: “Don’t go shooting off your mouth about things you don’t understand!” I couldn’t agree more.	医生朋友下午还发给我一个视频。视频内容是一个年轻人在普及医学论文之类。其中，他反复讲到一句话：你看不懂的东西，不要随便喷。我是太赞同这个观点了。
1.2820	Twenty-six medical professionals have now died in the fight against the coronavirus. I hope they rest in peace. The reason we take care of ourselves and stay locked up is so that their sacrifice will not be in vain.	一、因新冠肺炎牺牲的医护人员已达26名。愿他们安息。我们现在管好自己，关门闭户，也是为了不让他们白白牺牲。
1.2820	Day 62 of the Wuhan quarantine. This is also the 60th installment in my diary; you could also refer to this as my final chapter.	封城第62天。也是我的记录的第60篇，说是终篇也可以吧。
1.2819	I decided to just let everything go and slept all the way up until noon today. (It is actually not uncommon for me to sleep in like that, but in normal times I would blame myself for being so lazy. These days, however, everyone in Wuhan is saying: “On those sunny days when we till the crops, It’s hard to get a good night’s rest! We sleep all morning; we sleep all afternoon.”3 When people are all sleeping in like that, it is hard not to just let things go!)	坦坦荡荡地睡到中午12点（其实平时也差不多起得这么晚，只是平时会自责。而现在，武汉人说：锄禾日当午，睡觉好辛苦。睡了一上午，还有一下午。这样一来，不可能没有坦荡感呀！）。
1.2809	I wonder if this post will also be deleted by the censors.	今天这篇还会被删吗？
1.2755	Once the team of experts arrived in Wuhan, were they really unable to grasp the fact that this was a contagious virus, capable of being transmitted between people?	2、专家组抵达武汉后，真的无法掌握人传人的疫情实况吗？
1.2712	The wildfires continue to burn for now but when the spring winds blow, life will return.	野火烧不尽，春风吹又生
1.2677	I surfed the web on my phone as I ate lunch but most of the news was more of the same items from the previous few days. Much of it is those fearmongering essays that friends keep forwarding, often the same content, just with different headlines. My phone doesn’t even have enough memory for all these stories, so I find myself deleting a lot of this content, just like the internet censors.	吃饭时，依然在网上浏览。更多的还是前几日的陈旧信息。一咋一唬的东西仍然多。朋友们重复着发，改头换面着发，交叉着发。手机的容量都不够了，于是自己也像网管一样，开启删除风暴。
1.2661	Fang Fang: There are a lot of people whose stories have moved me, but I don’t have any plans to write a novel about what has happened here. I already have too many writing projects that I’m doing right now.	方方：有很多人触动过我，也感动过我，但我并没有想过写小说，因为我自己手上的写作计划已经太多了。
1.2611	Spring is now here. Spring is a season of awakening; it is also a season of hope. That awakening and hope are embodied in a poem that begins: “The wildfires continue to burn for now, but when the spring winds blow life will return.”24	现在正是春天。春天是让人觉悟的季节，也是给人信心的季节。这个觉悟和信心就是：野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。
1.2607	Some people have accused the majority of Chinese writers of being mute throughout this coronavirus outbreak; what drove you to speak out? Especially considering how frequently your diary places blame on government officials and raises criticisms . . .	5、有人说，此次疫情中，中国作家集体失声，为什么您要出声？尤其是您的日记里面有相当多对不作为官员的指责和对武汉的批评……
1.2558	For the next few days, things will go on as they have. We will still fully support our government by hunkering down at home and following this through to the very end. I just hope things turn around soon; I’m waiting for the quarantine to be lifted, but praying even harder for those patients to recover.	剩下的日子，还将继续。我们依然会全力配合政府，关门闭户，坚持到底。只期待拐点更快到来，期待武汉尽快解封，更祈祷病人们悉数痊愈。
1.2540	The weather today is just like yesterday—still gloomy, but not quite as overcast.	今天的天气仍然像昨天一样。阴，但并不阴沉。
1.2514	The sky is bright but you can’t see the sun. But there is still a strong feeling of spring in the air.	天色明亮，阳光没了。但春天的感觉还是很浓。
1.2497	It is another clear day; the sky is crystal clear and I can imagine what that warm sun looks like shining down on those empty streets, a deserted Zhongshan park, Liberation Park, and East River Garden Lane; such a shame there is no one outside to enjoy any of that.	今天又是大晴天。简直晴好得不得了。能想象得到，所有温暖阳光全落在空寂的街上，还有空寂的中山公园、解放公园和东湖绿道，感觉好浪费。
1.2492	Day Two of the Second Month of the Lunar New Year, the dragon has raised its head. Normally, I suppose that the spring plowing should begin today? But it is unclear if there are any farmers out in the fields today. The clear weather continues and it is quite warm; it feels as if the large, bright sun might even be able to bake the virus out and kill it. The Chinese roses in my courtyard have begun to sprout; I haven’t really taken care of them, yet they continue to grow vigorously.	二月二，龙抬头。春耕应该从今天开始吧？但不知道，今年此日，地里有没有劳作的农人。继续晴天，很暖和，有一种大太阳能把病毒晒死的感觉。院里月季都在抽枝发芽，我几乎没有怎么打理它们，但它们依然旺盛生长。
1.2466	There are a lot of people saying they would rather read Fang Fang’s diary than read reports from official media outlets like Yangtze Daily. What do you make of that? Did you ever imagine that your Wuhan Diary would elicit such a huge response?	2、好些人说宁可关注方方的日记，也不愿意相信《长江日报》这些媒体，您怎么看？有没有想到武汉日记会引起这么大的反响？
1.2437	Originally I really wanted to continue the discussion about literature from yesterday; I wanted to pick up from where I left off and cover the period up to the present day. But then I received another essay forwarded from a friend, which interrupted me again. It’s a good thing that the discussion about literature is an old topic that I can come back to anytime.	本想今天延着昨天的文学话题，继续谈当年和现在。突然，又收到朋友转来的文章，只好再次中断。好在文学是个冷话题，早谈晚谈都无所谓。
1.2415	Once things get to this point, do you really think you can delete it all?	一旦走到这一步，你还删得过来吗？
1.2406	After those front-line hospitals first discovered that there was an outbreak, why couldn’t they just directly report it online?	1、一线医院发现疫情后，真的不能使用网络直报系统吗？
1.2382	It was at that moment that I received a message over WeChat from an old classmate: “Since we know you are in Wuhan, we are even more concerned about the fight against the coronavirus that is currently raging there and we want to express our support!” That’s right. I graduated in 1963 and was assigned to Wuhan to work at Southcentral Architecture and Design Institute. There were three of us from my graduating class who got sent to Wuhan, and I was the only one who stayed here all these years.	就在此时，微信里传来建三同学的声音：“因为你在武汉，所以我们会更加关心和支持武汉的抗疫斗争！”是的，63年我班毕业分配到武汉（中南建筑设计院）的，共有3人，如今只有我一人尚在武汉坚守。
1.2362	I scrolled through my cellphone as I ate breakfast and the news wasn’t too bad; there was actually a lot of good news for a change. What I mean by so-called good news are headlines like: “Although the coronavirus situation is still grave, there has been a turn for the better.”	吃饭时看手机信息，还好，有很多好的消息传来。所谓好消息，亦即：尽管疫情依然严峻，但是局面明显好转。
1.2333	The news that Old Fox forwarded to me today was really quite shocking. I’ll copy the two items he sent below:	老狐的信息，让人一振，我原文照录这两条：
1.2323	Yesterday’s post on WeChat was deleted again. Besides helplessness there is only helplessness. Where can I share this record of my life in this besieged city? Mooring on the misty bank the messenger is filled with sorrow. To observe, to reflect, to experience, and, ultimately, to set my pen down to paper and write. Don’t tell me this is a mistake?	昨天的微信又遭删除。无奈之中，还是无奈：封城记录何处发，烟波江上使人愁。去思考去体会去落笔，这难道还是个错误？
1.2286	It is now day 54 of the lockdown; this hand of poker is over.	今天是封城的第54天，一副扑克都打完了。
1.2281	A bright clear day. I wonder if the cherry blossoms are still in bloom? Normally when they bloom the weather tends to be rainy and windy, so after just two or three days the trees are already bare. That’s why seeing the brief duration between the cherry blossoms’ blooming and withering always seems to leave us with all kinds of reflections about the fragility and precariousness of life.	大晴。不知道樱花是否还在盛开。一般来说，每逢樱花开放日，总是风雨飘摇时。三两天，就零落成泥。所以看樱花盛开樱花凋零，那种生命的短促，极易让人有万千感慨。
1.2280	Each word, every sentence, is backed up with genuine feelings. When he writes “if I die from this virus, that would, without question, be considered a form of ‘murder.’ I’m not going to stand for that!” I wonder how many people in Wuhan share those thoughts?	字字深情，句句真切。“如果因染疫而死，那无异于“他杀”，我是于心不甘的！”这该是多少武汉人的想法？！
1.2242	The weather is remarkably beautiful; it must have gotten up to around 20 degrees Celsius in the afternoon. With the heat on in my apartment it actually started to feel hot. But with nightfall, it began to suddenly rain, a strange and unexpected turn of events. Not that it really matters, though, since we can’t go outside anyway; instead, staring at my cellphone has become my required homework each day.	天气好到令人惊讶，中午温度快达20度了吧？开着暖气已有热的感觉。但到晚上，又突然下雨，很反常也很怪异。反正不能出门，看手机便成每日的必修课。
1.2225	It was only thanks to Zhong Nanshan’s sharp and stern questions that we were able to learn that human-to-human contact was, in fact, possible with this virus. It was only then that the people of Wuhan quickly awakened from their ignorance. Otherwise, had they continued to conceal the facts for much longer, it is hard to imagine just how much worse things would have gotten. Of the more than ten million Wuhan residents, how many would have survived?	正是有了钟南山院士的尖锐和严厉追问，才有了病毒“人可传人”的信息传达给百姓。由此，才使得武汉人从茫然无知中惊醒。否则，再继续隐瞒几日，还不知道更惨烈更残酷的恶果会呈现出什么样子。一千多万武汉人，能活出来多少？
1.2203	As soon as I wrapped up today’s blog entry [blog entry for February 6 was completed in the early hours of February 7], I heard the news that Dr. Li Wenliang9 has passed away. He was one of the eight doctors who were penalized for speaking out about the virus early on, and later he himself was infected with the novel coronavirus. Right now everyone in this city is crying for him. And I am heartbroken.	刚刚写完博客，便听到李文亮医生去世的消息。他是八位被训诫的医生之一，而且被感染到冠性肺炎。现在，全武汉市的人都在为他哭泣。心里太难过了。
1.2148	Today it is cloudy and overcast but not too cold. Outside my window you can see signs of spring everywhere. I let my dog out to play in the courtyard; it has been a full month since he had a bath and is starting to get stinky. Unfortunately, the corner of his dog tub is cracked, so it can’t hold water anymore and the pet store is still closed so I can’t buy a new one. It is another annoying little item that I’ll have to deal with in the next couple of days.	今日大晴。很舒服的天气。下午终于把狗送到了宠物医院。它的皮肤病再次发作，全身溃烂，不治疗也是不行了。我自己手指也裂口，不敢轻易处理。宠物医院很快给我发来视频，说洗了一大盆黑水。并且要把它的毛全部剃光治疗。这只狗是2003年圣诞夜出生的，今年底将满17岁，也是实在太老了。与我同期养的那些狗，几乎全部死了，只有我家这只坚强地活着，而且能吃能玩，现在有点老眼昏花，听力衰退。进入老年后，它的皮肤问题就很难治断根。平时我隔一阵送它去宠物医院洗药浴，吃药并治疗。但这一次，时间隔得太久了。好在，一切好转，有医院照顾它，我也总算放下心来。
1.2145	on this silent night my voice rings clear.	这集体沉默的鞭子，也打在了自己人身上
1.2130	Today I also reached out to one of my doctor friends to get a sense of where things currently stand with the outbreak. Mostly it was just me asking questions and him answering them. I could sum up our conversation with the following points:	今天又特意去找医生朋友了解疫情情况。其实也就是我提问，他回答。归结起来，大概这样几点。
1.2130	More bad news just came in from Central Hospital; Medical Ethics Committee Member Liu Li died this morning from the novel coronavirus. She is the fifth doctor from Central Hospital to pass away from this illness; I still don’t know how the hospital’s administrators are able to continue on in their current posts.	中心医院再传不幸的消息，医院伦理委员会成员刘励女士因感染新冠肺炎，于今日上午不幸逝世。这是中心医院去世的第五个人，不知道医院的主政领导怎么还能坐得住。
1.2127	The dark clouds of death continue to circle the sky above the city of Wuhan. Today one of those clouds floated past me: A famous editorial writer for the Hubei Daily just got infected, along with his entire family. They requested to be admitted to the hospital two weeks ago, but never got a call back. By the time they were finally admitted, his condition had already deteriorated. He died today. And today there is one more shattered family added to this world.	死神的阴影，还在武汉三镇上空飘来飘去。今天的一片又飘到我们眼前：湖北日报一位著名的评论员一家四口感染。半月前即申请床位，一直申请不到。待进医院时，已是重症。他本人于今日去世。这世上，又多了一个破碎的家庭。
1.2118	It has now been 16 days since the quarantine was imposed. Dr. Li Wenliang died overnight and I am broken. As soon as I heard the news I sent out a text to my friends chat group that said: “Tonight the entire city of Wuhan is crying for Li Wenliang. I never imagined that the entire country would also be crying for him. The tears people shed for him are like an unstoppable wave inundating the internet. Tonight Li Wenliang will sail away to another world on a wave of tears.”	从封城到今日，是第十六天。昨天李文亮死了。我很难过。当即发朋友圈说，今晚全武汉人都在为他哭泣。哪知，整个中国的人都在为他而哭！眼泪多得在网上涌起惊涛骇浪。这一夜，李文亮是在人们的泪水中渡到另一个世界。
1.2100	Beautiful weather paired with some good old-fashioned elegant Wuhan cursing really put me in a good mood and helped get this day started off right.	美好的天气，加上这顿痛快的汉骂，让今天的心情，有了一个好的开头。
1.2054	As both the virus and fear began to simultaneously spread, was a full lockdown really the best measure available?	6、当疫情与恐慌同步蔓延时，真的只有封城才是最佳选择吗？
1.2022	Today the weather continues to be good. The Wuhan people continue to hold steady. We are feeling a bit stifled from being stuck indoors, but as long we can stay alive we can handle the rest.	今天天气依然很好。武汉市民生活还是很平稳。闷是有一点，但只要活着，闷是能忍住的。
1.2019	How long can this deadlock last?	老这样搞，何时是个头?
1.1994	The weather is nice and clear. I stepped outside to empty the trash and through the branches caught a glimpse of the peach blossoms in full bloom on the slope across the way. I’m reminded of a line of poetry: “The shrubbery conceals not the colors of spring, as a branch of crimson peonies hangs over the wall.” Besides the fact that there is not a single person outside, the rest of the Literary Federation courtyard looks the same as always.	天气晴好。出门倒垃圾，隔着杂树枝，可以看到坡下的桃花正在盛开。有点“灌木不遮春色断，一枝红桃出墙来”的意境。整个文联大院，除了没有人，其他一切如常。
1.1955	The sky was really bright this afternoon, but later in the afternoon it turned overcast and even sprinkled a bit. My housekeeper texted me to tell me that she would be probably be here tomorrow. Deep down I heaved sigh of relief. My housekeeper is a pretty good cook; my colleagues used to always come by and end up inviting themselves to stay for dinner. I’m sure once we are allowed to move around freely again they will start coming back again to crash our dinners. My difficult days are now almost behind me.	今天中午天还很明亮，下午突然暗了下来，还下了一点雨。阿姨发信息说，她可能明天回到武汉。我的心头顿时一松。阿姨做饭的手艺不错，以前同事经常跑到我家来蹭饭，待市内可以自由流动时，估计他们蹭饭的时候又快到来，我自己的艰难日子也终将结束。
1.1945	Yesterday you mentioned two doctors from the front lines who were now struggling for their lives, Dr. Yi Fan and Dr. Hu Weifeng (Hu Zha is Hu Weifeng’s nickname); they both happen to be classmates of my jogging partner. She sends me updates every day on how they are doing, and today she told me that they have both woken up.	2、前两天你文章里提到的两位挣扎在死亡线上的医生易凡和胡卫峰（就是里面提到的胡渣，他的外号），正好是我这边一个跑友的同学，她每天跟我通报易和胡的信息。今天他们醒过来了。”
1.1898	Another clear day; if it had been any other time, there would certainly be a lot of people outside sitting in the sun. A shame that no one will be able to enjoy a scene like this for a while. But it is understandable; after all, these are unusual times. I suppose that we should be happy that we can at least enjoy the sunlight and foliage through the window.	依然天晴。如在往日，坐在外面晒太阳的人一定会很多。可惜现在，那种温馨晒太阳的画面完全见不到。可以理解，这是非常时期。人们站在窗口看看阳光，看看窗外的绿树，也不错。
1.1897	It isn’t as sunny as yesterday, but the sky is still quite bright. It started to turn a bit overcast by the afternoon, but it isn’t too cold. According to the weather forecast, the next few days will be relatively warm.	今天的阳光远不如昨天，但天空还很明亮。到了下午，有点阴。但不冷。看天气预报，这几天都会比较暖和。
1.1890	After the quarantine was in place, was it really not possible to have some of the confirmed patients transferred to other hospitals with less-strained resources where they would have received better treatment?	7、封城之后，真的不能将确诊的病人向其他医疗资源闲置省份妥善分流吗？
1.1878	But in closing, I wanted to respond to Huanggang XYM’s post by saying: Here in this quarantined city the people are anxious, amid the outbreak the people weep. We are all facing similar difficulties, why do we need to push one another?	只是，最后，顺便跟同在疫区的黄冈XYM先生留个言：封城闭户急，民在疫中泣。本是同难人，相煎何太急。
1.1799	That news we have been waiting day after day to hear has finally arrived: Today there are no new cases of novel coronavirus in Wuhan and no new suspected cases! My doctor friend also seems to be extremely excited: “We are finally at zero! Zeros across the board! The outbreak has been contained and we can now control all traffic from the outside coming in; now the main task is treating the patients we already have.”	今天终于盼来我们天天等待的好消息：武汉新增确诊归零，疑似归零！医生朋友的信息，显然也很兴奋：“终于清零了，三个零！疫情已经控制，境外输入可控，现在主要就是治疗。”
1.1780	In the end, however, the number of deaths we are seeing each day doesn’t seem to be diminishing, but that seems to be a consequence of early cases that were improperly treated. Once those cases got to a critical stage, it was already too late to save them. As I’m writing, my brother just sent me a text: Professor Duan Zhengcheng22 of Huazhong University of Science and Technology just died from novel coronavirus. This is a terrible loss for the university.	说到底，眼下去世的人数未减，仍然是早期延误治疗，拖到危重阶段，而导致回天无力。写到这里，我大哥发来消息：华科大教授、段正澄院士，于下午六点半因新冠肺炎去世。这一次，华科大损失惨重。
1.1778	Yesterday marked the first day of spring and today the weather indeed feels like spring. Across from our house is a row of old camphor trees, two osmanthus trees, and one yulan magnolia; the rich blanket of leaves makes one feel as if winter was never even here.	昨天立春。今天的天气果然就像春天。我家门前有一排老香樟和两株桂花一棵玉兰，树叶都绿得仿佛冬天根本没有来过。
1.1771	“Lamenting our difficult lives, I heave a deep sigh and wipe away my tears.”6 These days there are a lot of people expressing this sentiment.	唉，哀民生之多艰，长太息以掩涕。这几天，很多人写这个。
1.1767	Day 61 of the quarantine. I began to post this diary on Weibo starting on Day One of the Lunar New Year (January 25); that was five days after the lockdown began. Today marks my 59th diary entry.	封城第61天。我从初一（元月25日）开始在微博作记录，比封城晚了两天。所以，这是第59篇。
1.1754	Fang Fang: It is only if you have a different view of what literature is that you would think that. This is a diary; so there is no need for further revision. When I first started writing this diary, I would post each entry on Weibo, which is an informal platform where you can basically speak your mind. Moreover, I’m not just some idealistic artistic youth, I’m a professional writer. I write from the heart and try to truthfully capture what is in my heart; for me, that is enough.	方方：文学观念不同，才会有这样的想法。这是日记，是不需要修饰的东西。我初写时，是在微博平台上，微博就是个闲扯的地方，想到什么说什么。何况，我也不是文青，是职业作家。我手写我心，真实地记录下自己的内心所想，就足够了。
1.1740	But what really moved me was seeing the sanitation workers still out there sweeping the streets. They were all out there, as always, on each and every street, even though Wuhan is now cold and rainy with a gusty wind.	街上一如既往地井然有序。车辆和行人也还有，但都很少。我注意了一下，在我眼前出现最多的人有三种，一是送外卖的小哥。他们仍然骑着小车，奔波在各条路上；二是警察，他们大多站在各个路口，医院门口也有一些。天气很冷，站在外面，实不容易。基层警察是相当辛苦的，他们往往直面各种人等，执行他们所必须执行的任务。我听说，在有人病得无法下楼时，也是警察前去帮忙背人。有一个人刚背到楼下就死了，警察也哭。三是环卫工人，他们真是了不起。尽管人少，路面没那么脏，只是一些树叶。他们也恪尽职守，认真打扫，以保证整个城市的卫生。从疫情开始到现在，他们一直以从容的姿态留在我们眼里。最默默无闻的人是他们，但他们却一直在镇定我们整个城市的心。
1.1736	Everyone is just about at the point where they can no longer take it anymore (I feel really bad for those small children who still want to go outside to play every day!); we all want to get out. But there is nothing we can do; in order to stay safe, in order to survive, in order to plan for the future, we must just close our doors, stay inside, and wait. If there is one thing we can do to help during this outbreak, that is it.	人们都有点憋不住（可怜那些正处于贪玩年龄的孩子！），实在可以想见得到。只是很遗憾很无奈，以安全计，以生存计，以长远计，现在的我们还得关门闭户地等待。在这场疫情中，我们能帮上忙的，大概就这一件事。
1.1730	Your diary is so true to life; you record all kinds of little details about the everyday, even those emotional things that make you sigh. Did you ever consider revising it with a more polished literary language?	1、您的日记太真实了，里面记录的细节，所有的感叹，发出来的时候有没有想过或许可以用文学手段修饰一下？
1.1708	The weather is still overcast and it is starting to get colder. Dusk is coming earlier than before; if you don’t turn on your lights by 4:00 p.m. it will already be quite dark inside. The period we refer to as Early Spring always seems to last for several days.	依然阴天。有雨。天又冷了起来。连夜晚都来得早些，四点多钟，如果不开灯，屋里光线就显暗。所谓早春，总会有几天这样的日子。
1.1693	Day 60 of the lockdown; these days have been hard to imagine.	封城第60日。难以想象的日子。
1.1651	Yesterday was Day Two of the Lunar New Year and it is still cold, windy, and rainy outside. There is some good news but also a lot of bad news. The good news is that the state is lending more and more support to the effort to fight this virus; there are more medical personnel rushing to Wuhan to join the efforts here, etc., etc. All this gives the people of Wuhan some peace of mind. But I’m sure you all already know about this.	昨天初二，依然冷风冷雨。有好消息，也有坏消息。好消息是当然是国家支援的力度越来越大，更多的医护人员赶来武汉，等等等等，让武汉人心安了许多。这些，大家都已知道。
1.1614	Taking care of oneself is one way to contribute to the effort.	这种神圣感几乎来自于一种潜意识的觉悟：保护它，就是保护我们自己。
1.1588	Every day you seem to spend a lot of time following news stories about individual people. Besides your Wuhan Diary, do you have any plans to record the fate of some of these individuals during this outbreak, perhaps as a novel? Or are there any individual stories that have had a particularly powerful impact on you?	4、您每天都在关注个体的新闻，除了武汉日记，有没有想法将来把某个个体的命运记录下来，写成小说？（或者说有没有哪个个体的命运是最触动您的？）
1.1583	It is already Day Six of the Lunar New Year, eight days since the quarantine began. What needs to be said is that although the people of Wuhan tend to be naturally optimistic, and things around the city are becoming increasingly orderly, the reality here inside the city is growing grimmer by the day.	今天已经是初六了，封城近八天。需要说的是，尽管武汉人天性达观，武汉的工作也越来越有序，但武汉的现状仍然严酷。
1.1574	A large number of your stories all depict the people of Wuhan’s lives. What traits of the Wuhan people are you fondest of? Has the coronavirus outbreak revealed any new characteristics about the people of Wuhan that you never saw before?	13、您相当多的作品都是描绘武汉人的生活，您最喜欢武汉人的哪一点？这次的肺炎疫情，有没有让您体会到武汉人的其他不同方面？
1.1554	The way of the world is in a state of constant flux; there are warm-hearted people and cold-hearted people. That’s the way it’s always been. We need to just accept that. The best thing we can do is take care of ourselves.	疫情以来，关于“爱”，关于“善”，已经不那么空洞了。人们可以清晰地看到真善和真爱是什么。只是很可惜，还有些人，就是会喊，真要他们做的时候，你根本找不到他在哪里。我们习惯对那些虚幻的概念，狂热地表达爱并展示善，可一旦具体化，不要说狂热，就是一点点温度都触摸不到。这几天，透过视频，看到一些人对奔千里而归国的同胞，进行羞辱和谩骂；也看到一些人，对外出务工的湖北人，进行激烈抵触，真是让人有不可思议感。为什么就不能拿出爱国的热诚来爱这些人呢？
1.1548	The outbreak situation continues to improve. The number of new confirmed coronavirus patients today dropped to below 10, and most districts in the city are now down to zero. That’s a number that makes a lot of people happy. I started today in a lousy mood, but thanks to the good news about the coronavirus numbers dropping, I suppose things evened out a bit.	疫情继续向好。新增确诊病人降到个位数。大多地区，业已归零。这个数字，让人高兴。今天本是心情大坏的一天，但疫情局势给了我上好的消息，也算扯平了。
1.1523	The downpour was quite heavy last night and this morning it continues. In my mind, I always think of spring rain as being gentle and silent, perhaps even a little romantic, but today it is just flooding down from the sky; I suppose I’ll have to keep the lights on inside all day today.	昨晚的雨下得还不小，今天继续。感觉春雨的神韵本当是细小无声的，它却居然下得哗哗啦啦，屋里全天都得开灯。
1.1496	The sky is really glowing today; the sun even came out for a bit in the afternoon, brightening up this winter day. Yesterday the lockdown order was extended to every district. Now no one can go outside. This order was sent down so that the quarantine can be more strictly enforced. After seeing so many tragedies over the course of what has happened, we all understand why this needs to be done and calmly accept it.	小区的封闭令昨天已经下达到了各社区。所有人不能外出。这道命令，仍是为更严格的隔离而下达。经历过这么多天，看到了那么多悲剧，大家都能理解，并也都很坦然地接受了。
1.1482	The other person honored at the ceremony today was Dr. Li Wenliang. Li Wenliang was also recognized as an exemplary role model for his actions. I wonder if that is the end of his story? And I wonder if Li Wenliang was watching from the other side; if he could see what was happening, would he laugh or would he cry?	李文亮的调查，今天也出了结果。这个结果，大家是否接受或是满意，我不知道。我已经不想再说什么。李文亮死了，他的微博成为人们的哭墙，无数的人都会永远记得他。大家知道他不是英雄，他的生活，像所有的普通人一样，他做的事，也都在人之常情的范围内。但我们记住他，并尽可能帮助他的家人，就好了。那个结果，真的无所谓。而我们的纪念，说到底是在纪念我们自己，纪念我们有过的这段经历，而这经历中有一个最重要的人，他叫李文亮。不过，年轻人会比我激愤。下午，一个年轻人给我留了一个言：时代的一粒灰，落到中南派出所头上，就是一口锅。就像看到那些给“高中生”的回信一样，我也忍不住笑了出来。但是我还是想说，可能真的有些复杂。而那些复杂，是我们这些凡夫俗子无法弄清楚的。有些事情就留给时间吧，虽然我也不知道时间是否有用。
1.1442	Back when Soft Burial was published, it elicited attacks from all sides; how did you look at those attacks? And were you ever scared when there were so many agitated voices of criticism attacking you?	8、当初关于批判您的小说，您遭遇了庙堂和江湖两方面的围攻，怎么看？群情汹汹而来。害怕么？
1.1415	It started to rain again today in Wuhan. The sky is gray and overcast, the kind of windy and rainy day that leaves people feeling cold and depressed. When I went outside, the cold wind assaulted me, sending a shiver through my body.	今天的武汉，又开始了下雨。天色阴沉。阴沉中的风雨天，会让人有一种肃杀感。出门冷风一扑，浑身一凛。
1.1408	Today is another bright, clear day. I’m reminded of a book from my childhood, called Bright Clear Day, although I can’t remember what it was about anymore. A few days ago I thought that the plum blossoms must have all shed their petals by now, but yesterday I surprisingly discovered that all the crimson plum blossoms in our courtyard had broken out in a riotous bloom. In all the years past, I have never seen them blooming like that—gloriously announcing their presence amid a flurry of beauty and color.	今天仍然是大晴天。想起小时候，家里有一本书，名字就叫《大晴天》。内容说什么，早已经忘光了。前阵以为梅花已都谢尽，不料，昨天突然发现，院子里的红梅正怒放着。而且没有哪一年像今年这样，开得如此明丽鲜艳，一种隆重的在场感。
1.1406	These days fewer and fewer people are discussing the coronavirus while more and more people are discussing when we can get back to work.	这些天，议论复工的人越来越多
1.1400	Every family is going through a huge quantity of these disposable masks. They can’t be sold for such a high price. The government should really clamp down hard on all these people trying to make a buck through price gouging during a time like this.	口罩是耗材，用量大。而且专家说，只有N95口罩才可以有效防止病毒。但实际上，我们根本买不到这样的口罩。网上购买，必须要到年后才能收到。我小哥比较幸运。他们小区有家人的亲戚寄来一千个N95口罩（多么好的亲戚！）。我小哥家分得十个。他感慨说，还是有好心人呀。但我大哥家就没这么幸运。他们连一只N95都没有。只有我侄女带回来的一次性口罩。就这，数量也有限。只好在家重新洗过，用熨斗消毒，再次使用。真的有点惨（对了，我侄女说，新加坡接回他们的事，并没有最后确定，让我在微博说明一下）。
1.1396	I can’t remember how many days it has been since the quarantine began. The weather today is so beautiful that it may as well be spring. All the snow from yesterday has melted away without a trace. I looked outside the window from the second floor and could even see the leaves outside reflecting the sunlight.	也不记得这是封城的多少天。今天的阳光真是配得上春天。昨天的雪，已经一点踪迹都看不到了。我从二楼望下去，树叶在阳光下都反着光。
1.1326	The sky is clear and it feels like one of those perfect winter days. This is the kind of weather that really allows you to appreciate the winter season. But the virus has completely destroyed all of that. It may as well be the most gorgeous day in a thousand years, yet there is no one outdoors to admire it.	今天是大晴天。有着冬天最舒服的气韵。也是欣赏冬季最好的日子。但是疫情把人们的心情破坏一尽。万千美景，无人观赏。
1.1300	The sky was extremely dark and when I went down to the main gate at dusk to pick up a parcel, there was a light spring drizzle; I didn’t bring an umbrella, but it felt great to let the rain fall on me. Just as I got back to my front door the rain suddenly turned into a downpour; if I had arrived home just a moment later I would have been soaked. I guess I got lucky.	天暗得厉害，傍晚去文联大门拿快递，春雨纷纷，没打伞，感觉相当舒服。返回时，走到家门口，雨瞬间就下大，晚一步也会淋着，真算侥幸。
1.1284	But let’s get back to the coronavirus. After getting through the early stage of suffering and chaos, the coronavirus situation has been improving each and every day up until now, when it has clearly been contained. Today there was just one confirmed new case in Wuhan. There were 10 deaths today and there are currently no new suspected cases. The people of Wuhan are eagerly waiting for all the numbers to come down to zero, and then this will all be truly over. I suppose that day should be here soon.	继续谈疫情吧。疫情自结束早期混乱而痛苦的阶段后，一天天向好，现在显然控制住了。走到今天，还有一个新增确诊。死亡人数尚有10个，疑似人数归零。武汉人急盼所有数字都是归零，那才是真正的结束。想来，这一天，应该不会太久。
1.1261	One reporter from the Yangtze Daily named W claimed in a report that all Fang Fang knows how to do is make “wild accusations.” Well, there, I might be a slow learner, but it looks like I picked up this term pretty quickly. So I decided: Why not go ahead and make some more “wild accusations” today?	下午“今日头条”有一篇为长江日报的洗地文，当然更可能是“高级黑”。此文引用长报某记者的言论，对我和戴建业教授进行攻击和嘲讽，大骂我们是“喷子”。那位“高级黑”的阴暗心理，我就不谈了。但骂人的长报记者却真的过于脆弱，甚至缺乏基本的理解力和判断力。对于《歪歪扭扭七字遗书让人泪奔》一文内容，我只字未说。只是觉得它的标题应该是《歪歪扭扭十一字遗书让人泪奔》。标题改个数字，那将是多么好的一篇文章。甚至，我根本不觉得是写稿记者的问题。以我的经验判断，它从来就是后台编辑的问题。作为读者，不过是对标题提了句意见，便成“喷子”？说老实话，我一向对长报印象很好，从青年时代起，也给长报写过不少稿，甚至还与长报有过一些合作。多少年来，长报一直保有很多高水平的记者和编辑。他们的职业素质和高水准报道，何曾让长报有过今天这样丢人现眼的时刻。长报的被骂，是长报人自己的选择。而长报一向的好口碑，也是那些写媚文的人删遗言的人以及上面那类“高级黑”所砸。这是他们应该反思和检讨的。写到这里，本想索性狠狠“喷”上几句。转念算了，同学也在报社，实在不好意思让他难堪。
1.1128	Today there are a lot more speaking untruths than there were back in 2003. And there are no media outlets that dare to speak the truth. I just hope that all the official news we are now seeing about the new virus is all accurate.	离病毒最近的，除了医护人员，正是这些记者。记者们可以在病毒面前那样无畏无惧，却在疫情前期选择了缄默无语。这是件悲哀的事。话又说回，媒体人也可怜。可谓两头受气。上面不要他们讲真话，下面要求他们讲真话。他们经常无从选择。更多的时候，他们只能选择听上面的。既然如此，当下面的人骂他们时，他们大概也只能承担。我一向认为，只要是自己做的选择，自己就要勇于承担选择的结果。
1.1108	As the Wuhan outbreak was getting increasingly serious, why couldn’t hospital administrators have taken early action to prevent the serious lack of medical supplies?	5、武汉疫情日烈，管理者真的不能提前预判医疗资源的大匮乏吗？
1.1066	There is no peace when living amid a calamity . . . and “being-toward-death” is just a luxury of the survivors.	“一枚硬币的正反两面，都是容不得多样的生态，只准世界上有一个声音，一种腔调。”
1.1049	I did see reports of some people from Wuhan who had been in other provinces who are now suddenly facing all kinds of prejudice and no hotels will take them. My god, what a world we live in!	在疫情中，这些不幸滞留在武汉的人们，真是太边缘了。很长时间里，甚至没有人想起他们。后来，他们中的一些人没吃没喝住在城市的地下通道时，被记者发现，写了出来。人们这才想到：哦，还有这样一批人。哦，这些人太惨了。政府也出台了一些办法，让他们有地方可住。然后，又有这么多时间又过去了，想不到的是：他们居然还滞留在这里。他们比起有家的九百万武汉人，更急切地等待着开城。有时候想，这世上如果多几个有心人，帮着政府出出主意，想点办法，让他们早点回家，不也很好呢？比方，统计一下人数，看看他们的健康码，一个省一辆车，送他们到其省会，由对方指定酒店隔离，14天后即可回去。这也并不是件很难的事呀。想得到就能做得到。这个很容易解决的问题，可以帮助那么多人从困境中解脱，为什么不试着做一下？
1.1011	Let’s see if this post is able to be uploaded.	线索来了，该查的，就顺着查吧？
1.0938	Forwarding for a friend. A few days ago my colleague went in for surgery and she needs to go back to the hospital tomorrow to change her bandages. We already reached out to the community workers for assistance, and they said that they should be able to help arrange transportation.	于是给一个警察朋友发了信息，询问他们情况。朋友说他们一直都在第一线。而他本人一天都没有休息过。既要保障基本生活运输，又不能让人流车流泛滥，还得认真甄别。好多民警开车帮忙运送病人，仅靠医护人员是忙不过来的。还有，进出城的通道24小时都得要人守控，既要保障防疫支援车辆通行，又要外防输出。此外在医院、隔离点、社区这些地方，要维护治安和交通秩序，防止医患纠纷之类等等。因为接触多了，风险相对大一些！所以，这么多人感染，是不奇怪的。朋友说，你要好好写写警察呀，我们真的没有时间休息。
1.0937	One final item I want to mention: Today I saw an official user group on Weibo called “Fang Fang’s Wuhan Diary” Editorial Group, which was forwarding essays written by other people. I just want to publicly state that this group has absolutely no connection to me. I hope the manager of this group changes the name in order to prevent various misunderstandings.	对了，还要顺便说件事，今天看到一个名为“「方方封城日记」编辑部”的公众号，转摘一些其他人的文章。我得说明一下，这个公众号跟我半点关系都没有。希望公众号的主人改换其他名字，免得彼此都不愉快。
1.0860	I think that at this stage of the outbreak, what we really need are infectious disease specialists who can help us analyze the unique characteristics of the novel coronavirus. We need them to look at how this virus differs from other infectious diseases and then make scientifically based predictions about how this virus will likely behave, moving forward, so that we can adjust our strategies for future containment. Our strategy for controlling this outbreak cannot be guided by haphazard decisions.	疫情来了，从它初发及至扩散再至疯狂，我们的应对则从错误到延误到失误。我们没能绕到病毒前面拦截住它，却一直跟在它的后面追赶，尽管我们付出如此规模的代价。摸着石头过河这个思路并不对症，那么多可参照的前例，为什么不跟着学呢？直接抄个作业也可以呀？可能我的想法太简单吧。
1.0858	February	2月1日
1.0796	You aren’t the only one suffering and facing difficulties, there are a lot of ways to live.	我们都有创伤。掉头回望，我们不是幸运者，我们只是幸存者。
1.0786	Day 56 of the quarantine.	封城第56天。
1.0732	There are a lot of folk doctors whose ability to practice is hindered by the fact that they do not have an official medical license. As far as I know, right now there are two methods for capable folk doctors to attain a license: One is by going through an “apprentice training program,” and the other route involves presenting “proof of specialty”; traditional Chinese doctors can go either route to attain the legal right to practice medicine.	晚上，同学群再次讨论中医问题。班上的中医黑也不算少。中医学院同学再次阐明观点：严格说起来，中西医没办法结合：理论层面完全不同，是两股道上跑的车。现在的所谓中西医结合，实际上是用中医的药，加西医的器材、设备和部分药物：各自发挥所长。这里面其实有很大的问题，甚至是冲突。
1.0720	Last night one of my classmates forwarded me a letter of appeal that has been circulating widely on WeChat; the letter raises the issue of migrant workers, and I want to share it with you here:	昨天有很多人给某“高中生”回信。回信的事似乎延续到今天。而今天还有一封名为《几名高中生给另一位高中生的信》，我起先没有在意，以为是一些公众号写着玩的。没料到，一个朋友说，这是真正的高中生的回复。这才让我惊讶了起来，找来认真读了一遍。始知：高中生与“高中生”居然有这么不同。不同的不仅是文字，还有境界。文中有一句话，我觉得很有意思，忍不住要在此引用：“我们倒是想说，很多时候问题并非在于过度关注黑暗，而恰恰在于我们过度热爱光明了——乃至让这种强光损害了我们的视力。”我想说，原来孩子们真的不是我们想象的那样弱呀。他们其实是很有独立思考能力，并且也很有观察力的。在许多问题上，甚至比大人想得更深更远。
1.0704	The first group of medical volunteers from outside Hubei has been working hard for more than a month, and many of them have already reached their breaking point; they are now in desperate need of rest and reorganization. But where are the backup troops? There is no way the country will be able to send another 30,000 medical workers to relieve them! If we don’t get this outbreak under control soon, things will start to turn very dangerous. These are also comments taken word-for-word from my doctor friend.	局势的好转，在于举国之力，前来相助。方舱的扩容，床位的增量，援军的抵达，隔离的有效，工作的有序，加上武汉市民以坚韧之力的配合，齐头并进，病毒蔓延势头有明显衰弱迹象。再过几天，或许会更加清晰。医生朋友也下判断说，应该快了。说来道去，封城延时这么长，主因还是：
1.0701	March	3月4日
1.0697	Day 57 of the quarantine.	封城第57天。
1.0661	We have actually held out for a long time already; we can’t allow those people who have been fighting for us to have fought in vain and, for those of us who have been patiently holding on, we can’t just throw all that away.	还有，如果我们有足够的人道精神，同样不会为了战胜某一场非常厉害的大病，而把其他的病人遗弃。那时你的人道精神会告诉你：必须想尽办法，让这些同样在病痛中求存活的人继续得到治疗。办法不都是人想出来的吗？我们的社会条件不差，国力也不弱，解决这个问题，不是难事。问题是：你的人道精神有没有让你去为他们着想。你若想了，你就会事先考虑到这一切。唉，我现在经常会唠叨常识问题。而秉持人道精神，就是我们最基本最重要的常识。因为我们都是人呀。
1.0626	Forwarding to help get the word out. Everyone in China, please take in the people of Hubei, including those from Wuhan. No matter how they got out of Hubei, they all need food and a place to stay. Your enemy is the coronavirus and not these people from Hubei or those from Wuhan who are truly suffering.	邻居小Y告诉我，在他们的“影子梦之队”志愿者中，就有两个回不去的外地人，一个是广西南宁的，他是看到武汉疫情后，专门赶来当志愿者的，结果遇上封城，回不去了。还有一个是广东人，也是没有交通工具回去。志愿者队伍管他们的吃喝住。还准备开城后，帮他们买返程的车票。一直跟我介绍疫情进展情况的医生朋友今天也说，他有几个朋友，封城前来武汉出差，结果被都封在了这里，回家不得。这一待即两个月，来时尚是寒冬，此时春分已过，连衣服都没有得换。有个朋友是北京一家公司的老总，人回不去，公司也无法运作。
1.0614	Technology can sometimes be every bit as evil as a contagious virus.	像隔离病毒一样，与会咬人的群狗隔离，这就是常识。
1.0611	It is raining again and extremely overcast. It feels as cold as it was back during the Lunar New Year. One of my colleagues braved the rain to deliver some steamed buns, Mandarin rolls, and some other snacks to me. I have lived in the Literary and Arts Federation compound for 30 years now, and my neighbors and colleagues have always looked out for me, for which I am especially thankful. Tonight I will eat Mandarin rolls and a bowl of millet porridge. As I said before, cooking for one is never much fun.	又下起了雨，雨还不小。冷飕飕的，白天也如黄昏。远在成都的刘先生请他在武汉的朋友给我送来了几条鱼，推辞半天，没推掉。他们还杀好了，甚至连葱姜萝卜也都备好，说是让我煮鱼汤喝，这样做起来很容易。通过我日记看到我有糖尿病，他们又买了点干果，留下一封信，放在我们大院门口。实在是让我惭愧，又很感动。谢谢朋友们的关心。
1.0603	Anyway, that’s all I have to record for today.	就这样一点点的记录吧。
1.0599	Jiang Yanyong said: “When you must be thinking that Zhang Wenkang’s remarks are wrong, whereas Zhang Liping, Minister Wang, and others are able to freely speak the truth because they are already retired. In the past our country has suffered far too many consequences as a result of telling too many untruths; I hope that moving forward we will try harder to speak the truth.”	袁院士说：“我要讲一个真实说法，我们在武汉到访的地方可能都是‘示范单位’，我们问他们什么，他们就答什么，似乎已准备好。不过，钟南山就异常尖锐，他追问了好几次‘究竟还有没有？’，‘究竟还有没有更多病例？’，‘是不是真的是你们讲这么多的个案？’。但是他们的答案就是：我们正在测试。因为1月16日湖北省疾控中心才收到国家下发的试剂盒。最后他们被我们问出说：好像神经外科有1个病人感染了14个医护人员的情况。但他们也说，那些医护人员并没有确诊。”财新记者很厉害，继续追问道：“‘他们’是谁？你们当时考察武汉医院的时候，主要是哪些人士在场？”袁国勇院士的回答是：“武汉卫健委、武汉疾控中心、武汉当地医院以及湖北卫健委等人士。”记者继续追问：“你觉得当时他们对你们有没有隐瞒？”袁院士回答说：“我吃饭的时候看到与钟南山坐一桌的一个副市长，面色好差，心情沉重，他们那时候应该已经知道出大事了，因为第三批专家都到了。我相信他们之前如果有什么隐瞒的话，到那个阶段也没什么隐瞒的了。但他们一直在强调，试剂盒是刚刚才下发到武汉，没测试就没法确诊。”
1.0596	Forwarding this for a friend. They may have gotten off to a slow start, but at least the government is now taking action. The Hubei and Wuhan local officials’ lack of skills and inability to take the initiative has been instantly revealed by what happened this week. What is the point if all they can do is give speeches, conduct political study sessions, and clamp down on people who speak the truth? I won’t say too much for now, but let’s see how they apologize to the people once all of this is over.	昨天湖北的新闻发布会上了热搜。看到好多人吐槽。三个官员的神情，充满沮丧疲惫，频频出错，说明内心也乱。其实也很可怜。他们应该也有家人在汉，他们的自责我相信是真的。事情究竟怎么会走到这步，事后复盘，自然得知。武汉官方前期对疫情的轻慢和封城前后官员们的手足无措，造成了百姓巨大的惶恐，给所有武汉人带来伤害，这些我会在文章写细写。但现在我想说的是，湖北官员的表现其实是中国官员平均水平的表现。并不是他们比其他官员更差，而是他们的运气更差。官员们历来按文件做事，一但没有文件，他们就六神无主。这次事件如在同一时间落在别的省里，那些官员的表现，不会比湖北的更好。官场逆淘汰的恶果、空讲政治正确而不实事求是的恶果、不让人讲真话不准媒体报导真相的恶果，我们都会一一品尝到。武汉抢前争先，只不过先吃了一个大的而已。
1.0591	I usually go down to Hainan every winter to escape from the cold weather. This year was a bit warmer than usual and the Lunar New Year came a bit earlier than normal so I planned to go down after the New Year. But in the end I ended up stuck here because of the quarantine, forced to share the same fate as the rest of the Wuhan people.	说说我自己。除了心情与日常不同，生活倒是没有更多变化。以前过年，也是这样。只在初三时，到舅公杨叔子家拜年并聚餐（今年也取消了，舅公年迈体弱，更是要重点保护），基本上哪儿都不去。其实每到冬天我都容易发作支气管炎。曾经连续三年在春节前后住进医院。所以这些天我时时警惕自己不要生病。前几天有点头疼，昨天略有点咳嗽，但今天又都好了。以前蒋子丹（她对中医很有研究）根据我感冒的情况，说我这是“寒包火”。此后一到冬天，我每天都会用黄芪、金银花、菊花、枸杞、红枣、西洋参加上红枣桑叶茶煮水。我给它取了一个名字，叫“杂煮”。天天喝几大杯。疫情紧张后，又加上早晚一次维C片，一杯维C泡腾，外加几杯白开水。晚上洗澡，用略烫的水长时间冲洗背心部位，还把自己买的莲花清瘟胶囊全部吃光。我的同学教了一个“闭门法”，要我们时时默念：“全身毛细孔闭！风寒不入，百邪不侵，正气内存，邪不可干！”他一本正经说这是历代秘传，绝非迷信。我们大笑了一通，不知道有没有人真念。总之，我已经按各路朋友所教方式，将所有装备统统用上（除了闭门法）。显然，它们有用。目前我的状况还不错。保护好自己，就是帮忙。
1.0565	Life is tough, but we always find a way.	现在的疫情，尽管缓慢，尽管难熬，但总还是在向好转。
1.0535	Right now the entire world is watching Wuhan; everyone in China is sending aid to Wuhan. These days our transport networks are quite well developed; there is no way that people will starve here during the lockdown like they did in Wuchang during the war. So there is absolutely no reason for people to hoard supplies. I think we can completely trust the government on this.	另外还有些事，需要记录：各国都在给百姓发钱！那些消息，网上传得很疯，而那种发钱的力度，真的很让人羡慕。于是有人在询问，中国发不发？湖北发不发？今天看到一份建议，说湖北应该发一些代金券，以让疫情之后的百姓可以到市场购物，促进市场销售，保持市场活力，这样可更快地恢复元气。我看留言中，好多人赞同这个建议。在武汉，听说也有一定措施，比如对于弱势人群。来自扶贫办的信息：“为最大程度减少疫情对贫困家庭收入的影响，针对全市低保家庭、低收入家庭中的城市、农村灵活务工人员，因疫情影响不能外出打工，导致没有收入，按全市现行的城市、农村低保标准（城市780元/月、农村635元/月）的4倍，给予一次性临时救助。”跟我们看到的他国相比，差距有点大，但是，有比没有好。再说，没准大头在后面呢？
1.0528	The number of patients in Wuhan who have made a full recovery and been discharged from hospitals continues to increase. It is clear that as long as infections don’t turn critical, there is a very high rate of recovery. One of my classmates was just discharged from the hospital yesterday and has now checked into a hotel for a 14-day quarantine period. She is clearly feeling much better about her situation than before.	从医生朋友处传来的信息，也是好的。新增确诊病例进入低位运行期两天，而且下降明显；新增疑似病例早已处于低位运行状态。方舱医院依次休舱，最大的方舱医院武汉客厅今天也宣布休舱。新增疑似病例已可直接住院诊治。部分医院日常门诊也已经恢复。控制病毒蔓延，目前正在清扫战场，清零的时间指日可待。现在，重症病人尚有近五千，住院病人还有一万七千多。在全国顶级医疗团队的协同合作中，医生们也在不断总结经验，优化规范救治方案，让所有病人都能得到最好的救治。医生朋友的乐观，令我觉得这两万多病人出院，也是很快的事情。
1.0527	January	1月30日
1.0518	Day 55 of the Wuhan quarantine.	封城第55天。
1.0511	I haven’t worn a face mask in probably 50 years; putting it on makes me feel like I have returned to my childhood.	我自己也差不多。元月18日要去医院看望病人，无论如何得戴口罩。可是家里其实一只都没有。突然想起12月中旬去成都，学弟徐旻曾经给过我一只口罩，说成都空气不好。其实武汉空气也好不到哪去，我也习惯了坏空气，所以这只口罩我一直没用。这次算是救了急。庆幸刚好是一只N95。我戴着它去医院，去机场，也戴着它去买口罩。一连戴了几天，的确很无奈。
1.0460	I want to again emphasize that, while it is wonderful that the nation has been funneling all its energy and resources to fight this outbreak, in the process of determining the problems that need to be addressed, and as we adjust our focus over the course of this struggle against the coronavirus, we must respect the principles of basic science. Shouting slogans like “by any means necessary” is not based on good science.	还想说，这一次的疫情，让我们看得特别清楚的是：整个社会展示出的人道水准处于什么样的程度。疫情之后，恐怕得有人出来呼吁呼吁：加强人道主义教育，这也很紧迫。它本该就属于基础常识教育。平时我们在电影里看到，战场上，医护人员求助伤员，不会排斥异族异域，也不严格区分敌我。只要是人，他们都会拯救。这就是基于最基本的人道精神。而现在，这场疫情，就是战场，可我们展现出的人道水准之低，我真是不好说呀！
1.0431	Fang Fang: Completing the novel that I have been working on.	方方：小说到底是小说，它是需要虚构的。但写真实历史的小说，必须尊重历史。我只是把我笔下的人物，放进这段历史过程之中。所有的历史，都是有缝隙的。我在写历史小说时，脑子里会展开历史事件这样一张大图，然后，寻找出其中的缝隙，让我的人物在其中穿行。铭记历史这样的事，就是一个词的意义，即：以史为鉴。
1.0406	Everyone feels helpless right now, but at least things are starting to get a bit more organized. It is good to know that the country is stepping up and there are people now taking the reins, so hopefully things wouldn’t be as chaotic as before. After all the rumors and gossip that had been exploding over the internet, it seems that, starting today, people are beginning to calm down.	这几天，武汉疫情已趋缓解，但呼喊依然震天。最大的呼声就是用垃圾车拖食物给居民。昨天看到视频时，真是惊呆。什么人能想出来呀！无知无畏到令人发指的地步。是没有基本常识呢还是真不拿老百姓当人看？我不知道这里面有什么迫不得已的情况，但是再迫不得已，都不至于做得这样难看。
1.0351	Right now the crux of the issue isn’t whether or not Li Yuehua has an official license to practice medicine; the real question is whether or not his method of treatment works. If it is effective, then we should let him start treating patients. After all, shouldn’t we all be looking for practical solutions right now?	三、武汉在治疗病人过程中是否用了中药。医生朋友非常肯定地回答说，75%的病人都用了中药，有明显疗效。我问为什么另外25%不用呢？医生朋友说，有的人插管，用不成呀。插管者，显然是重症。这个比例很吓我。
1.0308	Tonight around dusk a famous writer sent me a text. He wrote something that I found to be quite profound: “Who could ever have imagined that a second catastrophe would befall the Chinese language itself?” Gratitude is a beautiful word, but I’m afraid it has been forever sullied. I wonder if, moving forward, it will now become a “sensitive term” that we aren’t allowed to use.	顺便说一下，前天我的一条微博被屏蔽了。它活着的时间比我想象得长。意想不到被很多人转发。因为我喜欢直接在微博这个小框框里写。所以写时会很随意（喜欢的就是这种随意感！），想到什么写什么。校对不仔细，错漏字也多（惭愧，有点对不起武大中文系），还望包涵。其实，我根本没有打算在这个时候批评谁（中国有句老话叫秋后算账是不是？）。毕竟，现在我们的主要敌人是瘟疫。我一定会和政府和所有武汉人站在一起，全心全意，共同抗疫。政府向市民提出的所有要求，我也会百分百配合。只是当时写到那里，觉得反思也很必要。由此，就反了一下思。
1.0230	March 20, 2020	3月20日
1.0208	While I am hoping this outbreak will end quickly, I am at the same time terrified about the day that all those thousands of Wuhan families will have to hold funerals for their lost loved ones. I’m not sure if there are other psychologists out there who can provide other useful and practical measures that can make things even a little bit easier for these grieving families.	其实大约在近十天前，我已听说福利院老人因受感染而连续死亡的事。尽管信息源可靠，但我因无法进一步确认，也就没提。毕竟，那么多人在等着骂我，而封号的刀也一直架在头上。现在，记者极尽详细的采访，地点数字人名时间，都清清楚楚摆在面上，还有谁能回避这些呢？“眼泪都哭干了”这样的话，已远远表达不了我们心中的悲痛。
1.0199	I’m thankful that this year I didn’t leave early for Hainan. Otherwise my daughter would have been left alone here in Wuhan and I would have been a nervous wreck. If I had left I would have made sure to come back to her, even if I had to walk to get here! But things are okay now; mother and daughter are each self-quarantined in our own apartments for the New Year. I feel much better this way.	像向先生这样的空巢老人，整个武汉，应该不少。以前的日常生活，尚有保姆或钟点工前去帮助。而现在，大多保姆和钟点工人都回家过年，一切只能靠自己。我曾经担心刘道玉老校长是否也是家中无人，因为他们平时也是靠保姆帮忙。微信沟通了一下，知道刘校长的儿子儿媳均已回家过年，正好堵在家中，可以照顾到两位老人。我的同学老道父母双双96岁，也被封在自己的小区，儿女们无法前去相助。得幸两位老人身体健康，一切尚能自理。不仅不给社会添麻烦，还尽量不让儿女担心，且以乐观的态度和所有市民一起等待疫情结束。
1.0196	It is a dark and overcast day; my mood has also turned gloomy with the weather. There is a heavy feeling in the air; the sense of gloom seems to be everywhere. There is no big change with the outbreak compared to yesterday; still over 100 new cases, so I guess we are still at a deadlock. How long can this deadlock last? Will it be over by next week?	封城的第二十一天。有点恍惚感。我们居然被封这么久了？我们还能在群里说笑？还能相互调侃？还能从容地盘点自己吃了些什么？我们真是很厉害。
1.0192	Don’t gather in groups, don’t go outside, don’t try to be cool. If you do have to go out be sure to wear a face mask, keep washing your hands, and keep gargling with salt water. Taking care of yourself is the best way to help.	早上还有个视频，一位妇女，不戴口罩，坚持要出门。无论怎么劝说，她就是不肯回去，也不肯戴着口罩跟人说话。遇上这样的人，下沉的公务员也好，社区工作人员也好，真是无奈。还有一个视频，是一条小街，人来人往，小店都开着门，热闹一如往常。拍视频的人边拍边道：这么自由，哪里像在武汉呀。我认识的人甚至能叫出那条街的名字。似这样的场面，多有几个，隔离几乎无甚意义。他们多半认为疫情与他们无关，但疫情控制得缓慢，我们也不得不继续关在家里，却跟他们大大有关。
1.0110	February 16, 2020	2月20日
1.0109	I read a really interesting interview in Caijing magazine with Professor Wang Liming from Zhejiang University. Many of the ideas that Professor Wang expressed in this interview were quite smart and helped me understand some of the things I had been confused about. These are a few highlights from the interview:	今天看到微博上有人转发当年朱镕基总理在上海作自我介绍的视频。其中有一句话：“我的信条是独立思考。”这句话，我很喜欢。这也是我所想的。大学刚毕业时，我参加一次文学会议，老作家姜弘先生在会上说，我们的脑袋要长在自己的肩上。这话给我留下深刻印象。是的，我们的脑袋不是长在老师的教导中，也不是长在报纸上，更不是长在会议文件里，它是长在自己的肩上。我们的脑袋要用来独立思考才更有价值。所以，无论极左骂或极右批，都不会改变我自己看这个世界的目光，也不会动摇我对社会和人性的思考。昨天跟易中天学长闲聊，我说极左和极右在本质上是一样的。他深表同意。之所以说这两个极派一样，乃是因为他们都容不下别人与他们想得不同。用易学长的话说：“一枚硬币的正反两面，都是容不得多样的生态，只准世界上有一个声音，一种腔调。”
1.0105	March 18, 2020	3月19日
1.0100	But all we have gotten is endless waiting—waiting for the city to reopen, waiting for an explanation.	转眼正月已过。我们已经不再细数封城有多少天了。反正就是在家安静地、抱以忍耐心地、尽可能平心静气地等待。不是等待拐点，而是等待何时可以出门。在我看，拐点来不来，似乎已不重要。它行踪难寻，又何必苦苦去求？或许正如雷神医院王院长所说，拐点已经过去。毕竟，武汉最恐惧最悲惨也是最痛苦的日子，已然远去。现在的疫情，尽管缓慢，尽管难熬，但总还是在向好转。
1.0099	We are now 59 days into the quarantine. It has been such a long time.	封城第59天。这么长时间了！
1.0086	The doctors in Wuhan have it the worst. I’m afraid that this year the doctors won’t have a break during the Lunar New Year. I salute them.	在郁闷的日子里，没有比这更好的消息了。易凡是中心医院胸外科副主任医师，胡卫峰是泌外科副主任。前几天报纸上还登载了他们尚处于濒危状态，我的日记中也摘录过。现在，他俩已经苏醒。简直是太好太好了。期待另两位濒危医生能坚持住，相信高明的医生们也会让他们都醒过来。
1.0078	Lamenting our difficult lives, I heave a deep sigh and wipe away my tears.	无数的个人悲伤，郁结成块，或许会成一个难解的题。不如，开辟一个空间，让大家同哭一场吧。
1.0039	March 15, 2020	3月15日
